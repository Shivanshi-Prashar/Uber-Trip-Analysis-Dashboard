* **Walkthrough of Key Visuals:**

  * **Overview Analysis Page:** Shows summary KPIs like Total Bookings (103.7K), Total Revenue (\$1.6M), Avg Booking Value (\$15), Avg Distance (3 miles), and Avg Time (16 min). Includes breakdowns by payment types, trip times (day/night), and vehicle types.
  * **Time Analysis Page:** Displays total bookings by pickup time, day of the week, and hour-wise heatmaps. Shows when demand peaks during the day.
  * **Details Page:** Provides a tabular view of each trip with filters for city and date. Useful for detailed inspection and audits.

* **Business Impact & Insights:**

  * Identified **UberX** as the most used vehicle type (38K+ bookings).
  * **Uber Pay** is the dominant payment method (67%+ usage).
  * **Sunday** had the highest booking revenue (\~\$19.2K).
  * Most frequent pickup: **Penn Station/Madison Sq West**
